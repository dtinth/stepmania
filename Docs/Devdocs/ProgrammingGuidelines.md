This document is to explain how things will work with StepMania 6.

Formatting will come later.

1) C++11 is to be used. Macros are fine if used wisely.
2) Try to avoid hungarian notation when possible.
3) Don't break encapsulation. There should be no public fields in classes.
3b) Public fields in structs depends on the situation.
4) Keep the code as clean and pedantic as possible.
4b) In the event windows and non-windows compilers disagree,
assume the non-windows compilers get priority.
